# Known issues

Issues found during testing that are deliberately deferred. Each lists the step that should address it.

## Resolved in v2.6

### Stalemates and timeouts
- The Extinction Event (from 20:00) and the 27:00 limit end every match. v2.6, 20 matches per row: zero timeouts in the AI ladder, the same-personality ladder and every bot row; the longest match was 23:12, none ran past 26:00, and the score decided 0–3 matches per row.
- This also removes the flake in `AI vs AI match on <difficulty> plays to a finish` (`tests/sim.test.js`): the match can no longer reach 30 minutes.

### War Factory tree: numbers for the later balance and AI audit (v2.14)
v2.14 was implementation only: no tuning, and the AI got minimal path support. Measured, not tuned:
- **Forced-path matrix** (Hard, each personality against itself, one side forced onto Siege and the other onto Assault, 40 matches each, zero timeouts, longest 23:09). Siege beat Assault 133–27 overall (83%). Per personality, Siege–Assault: Aggressor 23–17, Economist 38–2, Trickster 35–5, Turtle 37–3.
- **Likely main cause: the AI's base-attack logic.** The AI only launches a siege push with at least 2 Artillery or Titans (`aiUpdate`, strategy section: `nSiege >= 2`), so an Assault AI never sieges. It has to win field fights or wait for the late all-in.
- **Units trained, share by value** (per personality: Aggressor, Economist, Trickster, Turtle):
  - On Assault: Flame Tanks 6%, 6%, 16%, 6%; Hydras 0–1%. Hydras are rare at T3 (360/140).
  - On Siege: Artillery 2%, 9%, 11%, 10%; Titans 0%, 5%, 1%, 9%.
  - Riflemen: 47–48% for the Aggressor (both paths), 9–27% for the others.
- **Ladder sanity check:**
  - Easy lost 0–20 to Normal and 0–20 to Hard.
  - Normal vs Hard was 13–27 over 40 matches (main v2.13: 15–25).
  - The calibrated Rifleman rush won 9 of 20 on Normal (main: 16 of 40) and 1 of 20 on Hard.
  - Turtle and Eco bots lost 0–20.
  - Zero timeouts throughout.
- **For the audit:**
  - let an Assault AI siege with Flame Tanks and Hydras (or count Tanks), or add path-aware attack rules;
  - Hydra cost and T3 timing;
  - the default paths (Aggressor and Trickster on Assault);
  - re-check the Barracks matrix (Mass vs Specialists) now that Flame Tanks exist.

### Upgrade trees: re-check after the War Factory and Tech Lab trees (v2.13)
- **Mass Deployment sits near the top of the range.** In the forced-path matrix (Hard, each personality against itself, 40 matches each, 160 in total), Mass Deployment beat Specialists 94–66: a 58.8% win rate, inside the 40–60% target. Per personality (information only): Aggressor 24–16, Economist 17–23, Trickster 27–13, Turtle 26–14 for Mass.
- **Riflemen are about 37% of credits spent on units,** pooled over both paths, against a target of about 35%. That's about 50% on the Mass path alone, and 26% on main before trees. The figure is an estimate converted from value shares, weighting personalities equally.
- Accepted for v2.13. Re-check both numbers once Flame Tanks (a hard counter to massed infantry) and the Tech Lab tree land.

### Long matches run past 80 timeline lines per side (v2.10)
- Since v2.10 a build or upgrade and its finish share one line, which brought typical matches to 63–76 lines per side (median 72 over 8 AI matches). Long matches (14–22 minutes) still reach 85–156 lines, because key events are never merged or cut.

### Normal holds the calibrated Rifleman rush a little less often (v2.8)
- With one shared ability cooldown, AI Normal beats the calibrated rush in 61 of 100 matches (ladder 60 plus the per-personality rows 40), against 68 of 100 in v2.7. The gap is within about two standard deviations, so it may be noise; Easy, Normal and Hard keep their order (Normal vs Hard: 24–36 over 60, v2.7 20–40).

### The Aggressor still loses to the eco bot
- Step 6 gave it an ability-based answer (it strikes Turrets and defenders dug in under the enemy HQ before pushing), and it beats the turtle bot 10–0 on Normal and Hard and the calibrated rush 16–4 on Hard.
- Against the eco bot (Refinery-heavy, no Turrets) it still loses: v2.6, 10 matches each, 4–6 on Normal and 0–10 on Hard (v2.5: 1–9 and 0–7; v2.1: 0–9 and 0–8).

### Narrow Normal-vs-Hard margins in two mirrors
- With both sides the same personality, Normal beats Hard about 4 times in 10 for the Economist and the Trickster: v2.6, 60 matches each, 25–35 for both (v2.4 Economist: 31–42 over 80). Hard still wins the majority, but a single 20-match row can come out even.
